## WTA

I've generated the slam winners for women from the jeff sackman
database, but it has only data from 1968 onwards whereas wikipedia has
data from the first slams and i want that.

This takes from the wikidedia pages and creates wtaslam.tsv.

The parent directory has a soft link to this and uses that softlink to
query these files.

As and when JS updates his data, we can append here.
I would prefer not to have to process the wiki pages over and over since
the format changes across different slams, and can change later.
